# Intent Training Tools


A series of tools to enable management and testing of intents within Watson Assistant instances. These are best used alongside the Training at Scale paper (*link soon*).

- **Notebooks:** in the root of this repo there are two notebooks to perform exploratory analysis and targeted training.
- **CLI tools:** various tools to manage training, which are used in the notebook but can also be used separately. There's a separate readme for these within the `cli_tools` folder.
- **Conversation test:** two small modules for performing blindset and kfold tests on Watson Assistant workspaces.
